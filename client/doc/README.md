# *eesibot* Robotics Framework #

The *eesibot* framework is an open-source software package that simplifies building remote-controlled robots with a browser-based touch interface. The framework contains firmware for the embedded device (currently only the ESP8266 is supported) and a set of Javascript libraries that run in the mobile device browser.

The end user can customize both the user interface and control scheme by editing a single Javascript file. A full-featured robot, with drive and multiple auxilliary systems can be implemented in under 50 lines of code.
